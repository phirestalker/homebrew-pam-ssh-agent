            **macOS Security Configuration (IMPORTANT):**

            This formula has built a statically-linked module. However, due to macOS's
            Hardened Runtime, you MUST sign the module with a locally created code
            signing certificate for it to be loaded by system processes like `sudo`.
            If you have not done so, please follow these steps:

            1. Open Spotlight by pressing (âŒ˜ + Space), type "Keychain Access", and press Enter.
            2. In the menu bar, go to: Keychain Access > Certificate Assistant > Create a Certificate...
            3. Set:
            - Name: pam-signer
            - Identity Type: Self-Signed Root
            - Certificate Type: Code Signing
            4. Click "Create", then "Done".
            5. In Keychain Access, find the "pam-signer" certificate, double-click it,
            expand the "Trust" section, and set "When using this certificate:" to "Always Trust".
            6. After creating the certificate, reinstall this formula to apply the signature:
            brew reinstall ./pam-ssh-agent.rb
            ------------------------------------------------------------------

            **macOS PAM Configuration:**

            Edit the PAM configuration file (e.g., `/etc/pam.d/sudo`) and add the
            following line at the top, using the full path:

            auth       sufficient     #{lib}/security/pam_ssh_agent.so

            **Note on Symlinking:** A symlink is NOT created in a system directory
            (e.g., /usr/local/lib/pam) because modern macOS security policies require
            using the full, stable, and signed path from the Homebrew cellar.
            EOS
        end

        if OS.linux?
            # Detect standard PAM directories on Linux.
            pam_dir = ["/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/security", "/lib64/security", "/lib/security"].find do |dir|
                File.directory?(dir)
            end

            s += <<~EOS
            **Linux Instructions:**

            To make the module available to your system's PAM service, create a
            symlink from the installed file to your system's security directory.

            if pam_dir

                A standard PAM directory was detected at: #{pam_dir}
                Run the following command to create the link:

                sudo ln -sf "#{lib}/security/pam_ssh_agent.so" "#{pam_dir}/pam_ssh_agent.so"
                EOS

                Could not automatically detect your system's PAM directory.
                Example command (replace with the correct path for your system):

                EOS
            end

            s += <<~EOS

            After creating the symlink, edit the PAM configuration file
            (e.g., `/etc/pam.d/sudo`) and add this line at the top:

            auth       sufficient     pam_ssh_agent.so
